Stock Analysis and Comparison System

This project is a Stock Analysis and Comparison System built using Python. It allows users to analyze the stock price movements over various time intervals (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) and compare them with market indices . It also provides the ability to visualize multiple stocks in a single chart for comparison.
Features

	1.	Multiple Stock Comparison: Visualize and compare the price movements of multiple stocks on the same chart.
	2.	Stock vs. Market Comparison: Compare individual stocks with market indices (S&P 500 by default).
	3.	Composite Charts: View stock movements on daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly intervals in a single chart.
	4.	Time Range Selection: Choose to analyze stocks over the past 10 years, 50 years, or a custom time range.
	5.	Time Interval Selection: Select different intervals (daily, weekly, hourly, or minute) for detailed stock data.
	6.	Data Caching: Save downloaded stock data to avoid re-downloading the same data, improving efficiency.
	7.	CSV Output: Save stock analysis data into CSV files for further use or analysis.
